Use the source directory to create the master resume:

	@ Make changes in source directory to have them
	 reflected across all profiles
	@ Invoke 'make' to build the resume
	@ Invoke 'make view' to view the resume
	@ Always build resume before viewing

Use create.sh to create a new profile:

	@ Enter newly created directory
	@ Make appropriate changes and build resume using
	 using 'make'
	@ Invoke 'make diff' to save changes to diff.patch
	@ Invoke 'make clean' to remove all files except
	 Makefile and diff.patch
	@ Invoke 'make edit' to populate directory with
	 tex files and apply saved changes, making it
	 ready for editing

Use delete.sh to delete a profile automatically

Use update.sh to update top-level Makefile

Invoke 'make' with target as profile name to build
 that resume

Invoke 'make' with target:

	@ 'backup-clean' to remove all backup files
	@ 'temp-clean' to clean log, aux and dvi files
	 as well as backup files
	@ 'clean-tex' to remove all tex files
	@ 'clean' to remove pdf files and all above
	 mentioned files
